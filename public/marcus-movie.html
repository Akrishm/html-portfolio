 <h1>The best movies according to Marcus</h1>
 <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
 <hr />
 <h3>The Last Samurai</h3>
 <p>I loved the setting of the movie and I am also a big fan of samurai movies.</p>
 <h3>Napoleon Dynamite</h3>
 <p>This is by far one of the best comedy movies due to the silly nature of all the jokes.</p>
 <h3>The Matrix</h3>
 <p>This is one of the best Si-Fi movies.</p>
